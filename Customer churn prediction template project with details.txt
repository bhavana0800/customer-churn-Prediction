Customer Churn Prediction for a Subscription Service

Description:
Overview: This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying customer churn in a subscription-based service. By analyzing historical customer data, the model predicts which customers are at risk of leaving, allowing businesses to implement targeted retention strategies.

Key Objectives:
1.Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring data quality for accurate predictions.
2.Feature Engineering: Extract and create relevant features that influence customer churn, including usage patterns, transaction history, and customer demographics.
3.Model Building: Utilize machine learning algorithms to build and train a model that can predict customer churn with high accuracy.
4.Evaluation and Validation: Assess the model’s performance using various metrics and validation techniques to ensure robustness and reliability.
5.Deployment: Save and prepare the model for deployment, including necessary documentation for future use.

Detailed Description:
1.Data Exploration and Preparation:
* Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and erroneous data.
* Applied feature scaling and encoding techniques to prepare the data for modeling.

2.Feature Engineering:
* Developed new features based on customer behavior and subscription data.
* Used domain knowledge to select the most relevant features for the model.

3.Model Selection and Training:
* Compared multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
* Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
* Trained the final model on the prepared dataset and validated its performance using cross-validation.

4.Performance Evaluation:

* Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Analyzed the confusion matrix to understand model performance in detail.

5.Results and Insights:

* Generated actionable insights from the model’s predictions.
* Provided recommendations for improving customer retention based on the analysis.

6.Future Work:

* Suggested areas for further research and potential improvements to the model.

Customer Churn Prediction Template

1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

2. Load Data
python
Copy code
# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('customer_churn_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
data.head()

3. Data Preprocessing

# Basic data cleaning
data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove rows with missing values

# Feature selection
features = data.drop('Churn', axis=1)  # Assuming 'Churn' is the target variable
target = data['Churn']

# Preprocessing pipeline
numeric_features = features.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns
categorical_features = features.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())
])

categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ]
)

4. Build and Train the Model

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create a pipeline with preprocessing and model
model = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))
])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

5. Evaluate the Model

# Predict on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()

6. Save the Model (Optional)

import joblib

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'customer_churn_model.pkl')


Notes:
1.Dataset: You’ll need a dataset file named customer_churn_data.csv. Adjust the file path and column names based on your actual data.
2.Model Tuning: You can experiment with different models and hyperparameters to improve performance.
3.Deployment: For deployment, consider integrating this model with a web framework like Flask or creating a dashboard with Tableau or Power BI.
